          Hey there, I'm Karen. I'm a motivated and passionate aspiring software
          engineer with a background and master's degree in accounging. Iâ€™m a
          curious person, I love to code and I like to experiment with new
          technologies.

          Now coding is my passion and my new professional career focus. I have
          experience working with both frontend and backend technologies
          including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the M.E.R.N stack. When I'm not
          coding, I am enjoying family time, playing piano, watching re-runs of
          Friends, trying new recipes, and reading books.
